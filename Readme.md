# CS700 - Assignment 5 - Morse Code Encoder - Decoder

**Description** - This assignment consists of  implementing a binary tree to store morse codes, and using it to encode and decode a message. Below is the detailed description of  each and every file:

Files:

1. **a5_header.h** :
      - Description: It is the header file.
      - Functionality: This header file contains the declarations of  various functions for encoding, decoding and building a morse code tree used in the main function. It is included in "a5_endecutils.cpp".

2. **a5_main.cpp** :
      - Description: It is the main program file.
      - Functionality: This is the main entry point of the program. It takes input from a text file named "morse_code.txt" , then builds a binary tree to store morse codes and use it to encode and decode a message inputted by the user.

3. **a5_endecutils.cpp** : 
      - Description: It is the implementation file.
      - Functionality: This file contains the implementation of the encoder and decoder function along with the function for building morse code tree which are declared in `a5_header.h`. It is included in the "a5_main.cpp".

4. **a5_executable.exe** : 
      - Description: Executable binary file for "a5_main.cpp".

5. **a5_screenshot_console_output_using_terminal.JPG** : 
      - Description: Screenshot of console output and program execution using terminal.

6. **a5_screenshot_IDE_integrated_version_control.JPG** : 
      - Description: Screenshot of IDE integrated version control simulation for the assignment.

7. **a5_screenshot_terminal_git_commands.JPG** : 
      - Description: Screenshot of terminal with Git commands for adding, commiting and pushing various files of  assignment 5 to github.

8. **morse_code.txt** : 
      - Description: Text file with morse code for various letters in a particular order which is inputted in the "a5_main.cpp".
